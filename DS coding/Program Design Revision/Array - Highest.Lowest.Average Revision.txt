Finding the lowest / highest / average element in an Array and two-dimensional Array
--------------------------------------------------------------
What is it?
- Due to an array storing lots of values, we can use it to find the highest, lowest or average element.
- The biggest element is obviously the largest number inside an array.
- The smallest element is the value is the smallest
- the average is when we calculate the total of the array, in other words, add each element up. With that total, we divide by the number of indexes.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Find the average:

totalMark = 0					(Whenever we calculate the total INSIDE a LOOP, we need to set the variable to ZERO)
for x from 1 to 5
input mark							(The user inputs their mark into a variable called mark)
marks[x] = mark						(We insert it into the array)
totalMark = totalMark + marks [x]	(For every iteration of the loop, the element will be added to totalMark)
endFor
average = totalMark / 5				(We calculate the average OUTSIDE of the for loop in order to allow the loop to calculate everything)
print "The average is ",average,
end

Things to remember:
- If we do not know how many times to run the loop, we must ask the user.
- for examples: "Please enter how many students are in the class."
- The user will input the value into a variable, We then use that variable in the for loop
- input student
- for x from 1 to student
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding the largest element:

hiMark = 0							(we create a variable to check if the element in index 1 id bigger than ZERO)
for x from 1 to 5					(We loop for all 5 inputs)
input mark							(We input a mark from the user)
marks[x] = mark						(When the user inputs a value into the variable, we insert it into the array)
if marks[x] > hiMark				(This is the line we ALWAYS use for finding the BIGGEST element. We are computing the element to the value stored in hiMark)
hiMark = marks[x]					(If the element is bigger than hiMark, we replace hiMark with that element.)
endIf								()
endFor								()
print "The biggest value in the array is ",hiMark,
end

Things to remember:
- To find the highest mark, we ALWAYS make the value of hiMark equal to ZERO
- The logic behind finding the biggest element is, if the element is index 1 is bigger than the variable you created,
  replace the value with that element. Then compare the next element to the variable. After you repeat this process, we will have the biggest element.
----------------------------------------------------------------------  
Finding the lowest element:

lowMark = 99999						(we make a variable with a very large value)
for x from 1 to 5					(We loop for all 5 inputs)
input mark							(We input a mark from the user)
marks[x] = mark						(When the user inputs a value into the variable, we insert it into the array)
if marks[x] < lowMark				(This is the line we ALWAYS use for finding the SMALLEST element. We are computing the element to the value stored in lowMark)
lowMark = marks[x]					(If the element is smaller than hiMark, we replace lowMark with that element.)
endIf
endFor
print "The lowest value in the array is ",lowMark,
end

Things to remember:
- To find the highest mark, we ALWAYS make the value of hiMark equal to a VERY BIG NUMBER
- The logic behind finding the smaller element is, if the element is index 1 is smaller than the variable you created,
  replace the value with that element. Then compare the next element to the variable. After you repeat this process, we will have the smallest element.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combined example:
hiMark = 0
lowMark = 9999999
totalMark = 0

for x from 1 to 5
input mark
marks[x] = mark
marks[x] = mark						
if marks[x] > hiMark				
hiMark = marks[x]					
endIf

if marks[x] < lowMark				
lowMark = marks[x]					
endIf

totalMark = totalMark + marks [x]
endFor
average = totalMark / 5

print "The average is ",average,
print "The biggest value in the array is ",hiMark,
print "The lowest value in the array is ",lowMark,
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Two-Dimensional Array

What is it?
- A two-dimensional array is identical to a one-dimensional array except, that it uses two index values to locate its element.
- The best way to see how it works is using another table:
	index		1		2		3	
	index2 |1  "Bob"  "John"  "Sam"
		   |2  "Dad"  "Mom"  "Ben"
		   |3  "Jon"  "Fred"  "Gary"
- We insert and print from the array the same way but instead of one loop, we use two For loops.
