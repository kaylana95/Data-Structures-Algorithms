Revision for calling a function
---------------------------------------
What is it?
- Calling a function is when we go to the function, knock on its door in order to get it to start
- Because the function is a separate section, it has its own begin and end.
- We need to start the section up.
- We call the function by typing the name of the function.
- Wherever we are in the program (either the main program or another function) we can call a function.
- If the function has a parameter, we need to call the function name and include the function name and include the value of that parameter
- The value we send to the parameter is called an argument
- The program will always divert to the function when we call the function
- Once the function is done, we will return to where the function call was

What does it look like?
	program main
	begin
	function name(argument)			(This is how we call a function)
	end
	
Example:
	program main
	begin
	name("Bob")						(We are calling a function by calling its name and sending the argument into the parameter)
	end
	
	function name(name)
	begin
	print name						(We sent the argument "Bob" through the chimney down into the parameter)
	end
	
Things to remember:
- If the function has multiple parameters, we need to have multiple arguments
- The argument need to be in the same order as the parameters
- If your function has a parameter, you need an argument
- The way the program works is that it jumps to the function when the function is called
