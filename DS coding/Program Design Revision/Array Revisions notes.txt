Revision notes for inserting into Array
-----------------------------------------------
What is an Array?
- An array is a data structure that consists of data items that are called Elements.
- Each piece of data is sorted in a block. Each piece of data has to be the same data type as all the other blocks.
- Each block has a number that represents its position in the array.
- The first bock in the array is known as position 1. We call the position of the blocks, the "Index".
- 1  2  3  4  5
- [] [] [] [] []
- Each block has an Index, as seen above (numbers 1-5)
- Within each block, the value is an Element.
- An array must have a name.
- For example: marks[5] = 30 (this means there is an array called marks, with an index of 5, has an element of 30)
- The best way to see how an array is using a table:
	Index | Element
	  1   | "Bob"
	  2   | "John"
	  3   | "Sam"

Inserting / Printing to / from an Array.
------------------------------------------------
- In order to insert or print the element into / from an array, we NEED a For Loop.
- The role of the For Loop is to insert / print to / from each index in the array.

- For example:
for x from 1 to 10			(The loop is repeating 10 times)
print mark[x]				(For every iteration of the loop, the value of 'x' changes)
endFor						(Therefore, we can print each element from each index because the For loop repeats itself for every index)

- For example:
for x from 1 to 10			(The loop is repeating 10 times)
input value					(We input one value and insert it into the array)
mark[x] = value				(For every iteration of the loop 'x' changes)
endFor						(Therefore, each iteration of the loop we can add the value of the input variable into the specific index of the array)

When do I use it?
- When the question asks to make use of an array (or one-dimensional array)
- "Add the following into an array."
- "Print all the records / elements / values."
