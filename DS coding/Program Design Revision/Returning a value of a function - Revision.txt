Returning a value of a function
----------------------------------------------
What is it?
- As we know, we can now send a value into a function using a parameter
- a return statement is going to do the opposite and send a value back to wherever the function was called from
- A return will always be at the end of the function, basically one line before the "end"
- A function can only return ONE value, ONLY ONE!!
- The only way we can have multiple returns is if it is in an If statement, but still only ONE can be returned.
- The return needs to be stored into a variable wherever the function call came from

What does it look like?
- When we call the method, we need to create a variable to store the returned value
	Fro example:
		
		program main
		begin
		print "What you were you born?"
		input year
		age determineAge(year)						(There are two VERY important things happening in this line)
		print age									(1. We have created a variable called "age". It will store the value of the return)	
		end											(2. We are calling the function with an argument of year)
													(The program will always read number 2 FIRST!!!)
		
		function determineAge(year)
		begin
		age = 2019 - year
		return age									(The return always needs to be right at the end)
		end											(The age we are returning gets stored in the variable called age in the main program)
		
Things to remember 
- A function does not have to have a return statement
- A function can only return ONE VALUE
- The function will always stop once it has returned a value
- If you have multiple returns, whichever comes first will return and nothing thereafter.
