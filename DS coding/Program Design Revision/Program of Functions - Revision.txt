Revision for the program
-----------------------------------------
What is it?
- When we have function in our program, it is seen as a separated program.
- We will split the program into two parts: the main section of the program, and the functions
- The function section is where we will create all our functions
- The main section is where we will type our normal code
- Both main program and function will need its own "begin" and "end"

What does it look like?
	- We start the section with the word "program" followed by the programs name
	
	program main				(The program section. The program is called main)
	begin
	print "Hello everyone"
	end
	
	function printAgain()		(The function section)
	begin
	print "Hello again"
	end
	
Things to Remember:
- Look at the question. It will always tell you what to do in each section.
- It will say "In the function", or "create a function"
- It will say "In the program", or "create a program"
- We will call the function from the main program
- We will pass (send) the parameter from the main program 
- We will receive returned values into the main program.
