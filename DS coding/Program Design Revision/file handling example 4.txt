What must I do:
- Read records from file called student.fle
- File has records that contain three fields namely : student name, student number, fees paid (y/n)
- If students have paid fees, record must be written into file called paid.fle (number of records written into this file must be counted and printed)
- If not paid, record must be written into a file called arrears.fle (this must be printed)
