Revision for the Bubble sort
-------------------------------------
What is the bubble sort?
- THe bubble sort is an algorithm that will sort an array from the smallest element to the biggest Element.
- It works by comparing one element to another. If the element is bigger than the other, it gets shifted to the end of the array.
- The index of the array cannot move, therefore the element is swapped between indexes.
- Basically, they take the element in index 1 and compare it with the element in index 2.
- We will swap until we are one less than the number of indexes in the array. For example, if we have 10 indexes in the array, we will swap 9 times.

for x from 1 to 5						(we loop five time because we want an array)
input mark
marks[x] = mark							(we insert the input value "mark" into an array)
endFor

do while flag = 1						(we will attempt to swap the first two indexes whilst the flag = 1)
flag = 0								(if there is nothing to swap, set the flag to equal 0)

from y from 1 to 4						(we loop one less than the number of indexes in the array.)
if marks[y] > marks[x + 1]				(we compare one position [x] with another position [x+1])
temp = marks[x]							(we take the biggest number (marks[x]) and store it in a variable called temp)
marks[x] = marks[x + 1]					(we then store the smaller number (marks[x+1]) into the empty marks[x])
mark[x + 1] = temp						(we then insert the value of temp (the bigger number) and we insert it into marks[x+1])
flag 1									(swap occurred so we repeat the whole process again)
endIf
endFor
endDoWhile

for z from 1 to 5
print marks[y]
endFor

Things to remember:
- This code will always sort the array.
- The only thing you need
